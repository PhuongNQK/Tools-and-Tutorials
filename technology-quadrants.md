> good source. Published semiannually, the Technology Radar filters real-world
> project experience through the expertise of Technology Advisory Board members
> and divides technologies across four quadrants: **Techniques**, **Tools**, **Languages
> & Frameworks**, and **Platforms**. Within each quadrant, technologies are
> placed into one of four rings:
> **Hold**: Something is very new and not ready for widespread adoption or something
> is at the end of its lifecycle.
> **Assess**: Worth working through a demo or two, examining if/where it might be suit‐
> able in your organization.
> **Trial**: This technology is ready for a full-on pilot project in your organization.
> **Adopt**: You should be using the technology today
